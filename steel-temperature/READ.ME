Forecast of steel temperature

Purpose: The steel factory wants to optimise its expenses therefore it needs to forecast the temperature of steel after processing.


Process description:
- the first temperature is measured
- steel is heated with electrodes, bulk and wire are added, gas is used - temperature is measured a couple of times
- the last temperature is measured

Data description:
- `data_arc.csv` — electrode heating;
- `data_bulk.csv` — bulk added (volume);
- `data_bulk_time.csv` — bulk added (time);
- `data_gas.csv` — gas;
- `data_temp.csv` — temperature measurements;
- `data_wire.csv` — wire added (volume);
- `data_wire_time.csv` — wire added (time).

`Key` is a batch number
